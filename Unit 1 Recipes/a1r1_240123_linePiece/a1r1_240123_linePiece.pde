/* This is a plan for making the first recipe for
   assignment 1, which uses lines to recreate a piece of art.
   
   This is meant to give you a step-by-step guide to what to do,
   but as far as how to actually do each step? That's for you to solve!
   
   Remember, your code must be on your GitHub repository
   to be accepted for credit for the class.
   
   By the way, this is a multi-line comment. Look it up in the documentation!
   
   Below you'll see single-line comments.
