/* This is a plan for making the third recipe for
   assignment 1, where you'll do a creative treatment of one
   of Jenny Holzer's Truisms
   
   This is meant to give you a step-by-step guide to what to do,
   but as far as how to actually do each step? That's for you to solve!
   
   As a reminder, the video tutorials for this class are there to
   generally get you startedâ€”you should hopefully have a rough idea
   of how to do everything here after watching those videos.
*/

// optional: save our truism to memory in the form of a String
// optional: save our font to memory in the form of a PFont

// the setup function runs once at the beginning of the program
// any code we have in here will run once before anything else
void setup(){
  // TODO: set the canvas size to something nice and big,
  // but smaller than your screen
  
  // if there are any text styles we want
  // to set that won't change, do that here
  
  // if you are using a font, load your .vlw into memory
  // and then set the current font style
}

// the draw function runs every frame, over and over
// any code we have in here will run multiple times
void draw(){
  // TODO: paint the background a solid color
  
  // the steps here will be a little more open-ended,
  // depending on what you are doing with the truism.
  // but generally, you'll probably be using the text() function
  // or drawing lines and shapes to draw the words onto the canvas.
  // i encourage you to be creative with your design here!
  
  // save a copy of our canvas on the first frame so we have a clean .png
