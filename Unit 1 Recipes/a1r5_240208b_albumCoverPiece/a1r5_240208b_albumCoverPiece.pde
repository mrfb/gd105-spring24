/* This is a plan for making the fifth and final recipe for
   assignment 1, where you'll make an album cover
   
   This is meant to give you a step-by-step guide to what to do,
   but as far as how to actually do each step? That's for you to solve!
   
   As a reminder, the video tutorials for this class are there to
   generally get you startedâ€”you should hopefully have a rough idea
   of how to do everything here after watching those videos.
